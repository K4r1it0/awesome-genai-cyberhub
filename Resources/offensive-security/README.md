# 🚀 LLMs in Offensive Security (Red Teaming & Pentesting)

> A curated collection of Large Language Model (LLM) resources focused on **applications in offensive security, red teaming, and penetration testing (for research and advancing defenses)**.

Welcome to the **Offensive Security** section of Awesome GenAI CyberHub! This space is dedicated to exploring (from a research and defensive perspective) how LLMs are being utilized to augment and automate complex offensive cyber operations. This includes the development of AI agents capable of autonomous hacking and penetration testing, advanced techniques for social engineering and phishing generation, AI-assisted exploit crafting and zero-day vulnerability discovery, methods for simulating entire attack lifecycles, and tools for automating red team tasks. We also cover the responsible development of such offensive AI capabilities. The purpose is to understand these potential threats to build better defenses. Here, you'll find links to relevant articles, research papers, tools, datasets, and proof-of-concepts.
